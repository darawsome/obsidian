### Reading Notes
- The reverend mother Gaius Helen Mohiam suspects she was either sold out by the guild, or failed to cover her tracks with the steersman when discussing overthrowing Paul. 
- Arrakis is a planet heavy with pilgrimage, much like it is with Muslim faith and the mecca, “everyone’s destination is Arrakis.”
- The sisterhood reminds us how deeply inhuman the organization is, to the point of instead of killing Paul and saving billions, they must try to breed him with his little sister to preserve the bloodline. 
- The plan seems to be shifting from killing Paul to killing Chani to push Paul into the hands of his sister, this plan seems useless. 
- The reverend mother does not trust the princess, to the point of even thinking she will destroy them. A dichotomy exists between them, as the princess is devoted to at least trying to show how much worth she has, that she should not be spent just yet.
### Summary
$\quad$This chapter takes place in a prison under Paul’s throne. The reverend mother, Gaius Helen Mohiam discovers she was ordered by Paul to be sent to prison for sneaking past in a guild ship. The qizara that captures her, bald with a turban, shows his philosophy when it comes to the emperor, someone who rules “free” space. Someone whose influence takes hold in every inch of the known universe. 
$\quad$ Princess Irulan, dismayed by her teacher’s capture, plans a secret discussion with Gaius Helen Mohiam on the next steps of the plan to overthrow Paul. This entire conversation is spoken through secret hand communication, hidden under meaningless words of formality. A shift in the plan seems to happen as the reverend mother takes notice of the emperor’s loneliness in being the only one with as much power. She pushes the demand that he must breed with his sister, something Irulan objects to as she knows how difficult it has become to supress Chanis’ fertility. This breeding between brother and sister seems to be part of a greater plan Irulan is not aware of.  A plan involving Paul’s death and the ghola’s immortality. For this plan to be achieved, Chani must be killed, at whatever cost. 
$\quad$ Irulan correctly interprets this demand as a sacrifice for failing to create a child with Paul, something that upsets her but motivates her to show her worth. The Reverend Mother on the other hand is much less certain of Irulan’s trustworthiness, to the point that she fears she could destroy the Bene Gesserit. 
### Analysis
```ad-quote
Melange was valuable, but it exacted a price—addiction. It added years to a life—decades for some—but it was still just another way to die.

This quote interested me the most from this chapter. An incredible bit of subtle world building behind what the purpose of a ghola is. Those who take the spice seek a longer life, a futile goal as death reaches them regardless. The ghloa serves a similar goal of immortality, one that is appealing to some but it brings into question if a ghola even is the original being, or simply someone new all together. Duncan Idaho does not seem to be the same person, regardless of maintaining the same memories. Paul knows this, and so do the Bene Gesserit, what this goal still eludes both the reader and Irulan.

This quote adds a lot to Irulan’s character arc, someone who suffers from two identities, one of Paul’s wife, and one of his betrayer. One of a princess and another of a Bene Gesserit. This is her taking her responsibility as both, giving into her duties to the empire as a princess as well as her duties to the sisterhood.
