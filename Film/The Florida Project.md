# Initial Thoughts on Florida Project

I won't say I am an expert when it comes to Floridian culture however, this state, despite its stereotypes generalizations it receives, is one of the most culturally diverse places I've ever lived in (granted, I've only ever lived in South Florida my whole life, but I have travelled a lot!). This is why, since hearing about this movie, I have been desperate to learn more about films set in the sunshine state.

Starting at this point might feel a bit odd since, Florida as a location and set piece, is my biggest criticism I have of an otherwise incredibly heartfelt and upsetting movie. But it feels warranted given the name of the movie, and the way it tries to make the state itself a mold that shapes all the people living in it.

The Florida Project is set in Kissimmee, which most people might not realize from watching this movie, showing how prevalent Disney World is throughout the film. This is intentional however, since although the much larger city of Orlando is what first comes to mind when thinking of Disney, Kissimmee is much closer, and more affected by its existence. Kissimmee is by no means a forgotten city, as much as it is a little factoid when seeing welcome signs for the city when passing through the highways to reach the Magic Kingdom, but nonetheless it exists as a background for this magical land everyone travels to Central Florida to visit at least one point in their lives.

This is the mold these characters, primarily Haylee and Moonie, come from. A city that is sometimes ignored but nonetheless hurt by the economic juggernaut that is the Disney Corporation. Haylee's life revolves around Disney World, to a jarringly sad degree, from her inability to get a job at the parks, to her desperate attempts at paying rent by selling cheap wholesale perfumes to much wealthier customers at the Disney hotels, and even the place she lives, where she exists paycheck to paycheck. And the way this park hurts her goes from blunt to insidiously subtle. This makes the ending sequence all the more harrowing, as it is the first and only time the audience and the characters themselves are even allowed to witness the magic of Disney World, only at the lowest point in all of their lives.

I might have gotten off track when discussing my criticism, but it mostly revolves around a petty desire for a movie called "The Florida Project", to portray more diversity in Floridian culture, namely South Florida and its growing influence on culture, politics, and climate, for better or for worse (mostly for worse).
